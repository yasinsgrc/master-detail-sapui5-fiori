## case_three

Create a JSON model which can be accessed by both the employee and the manager. The Employee’s view will be a form with all the fields and the Manager’s view should be a splitapp with master page showing all the requests and detail page displays the detail of the request and the footer will have two buttons to approve or reject. Once the manger takes an action, the request should be removed from the manger’s view.  Hint: to remove one or more elements from our JSON model we use splice() method.
